Depth First Traversal (or Search) for a graph is similar to Depth First Traversal of a tree. 
The only catch here is, unlike trees, graphs may contain cycles, so we may come to the same node again.
To avoid processing a node more than once, we use a boolean visited array. 


```python
from collections import defaultdict
#This class represents a directed graph 
#using adjacency list trepresentation
class Graph:
	#constructor
	def __init__(self):
		#Default dictionary to store graph
		self.graph=defaultdict(list)

	#Function to add an edge to graph
	def addedge(self,u,v):
		self.graph[u].append(v)
	#A function used by DFS
	def DFSuse(self,v,visited):
		#Mark the current node as visited
		#and print it
		visited[v]=True
		print v,
		#recur for all vertices adjacent to this vertex
		for i in self.graph[v]:
			if visited[i]==False:
				self.DFSuse(i,visited)
	#Function for DFS traversal
	#It uses DFSuse function
	def DFS(self,v):
		#Mark all the vertices as not visited
		visited=[False]*(len(self.graph))
		#Now call the recursive DFSuse function to
		#print DFS traversal
		self.DFSuse(v,visited)
# Main code
g = Graph()
g.addEdge(0, 1)
g.addEdge(0, 2)
g.addEdge(1, 2)
g.addEdge(2, 0)
g.addEdge(2, 3)
g.addEdge(3, 3)
 
print "Following is DFS from (starting from vertex 2)"
g.DFS(2)


```
